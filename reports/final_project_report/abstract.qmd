# Abstract {.unnumbered}

Social media has become an integral part of our lives, and Twitter is one of the leaders as a platform for sharing ideas, art, and general information. The increasing use of malicious bot accounts has tainted the platform, as these accounts can be used for malicious activities such as spamming, spreading false information, and targetted harassment. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable method to identify bot accounts on Twitter. To begin, the objective of the project is to correctly classify whether or not a Twitter account is a "bot" account (automated Twitter account) based on the account data (i.e. user tweets). By examining the tweets and user data produced by these accounts made available through the Twitter developer API & enhanced by the research article "Evidence of Spam and Bot Activity in Stock Microblogs on Twitter.", a machine-learning model will be trained to classify bot accounts. Finally, We will use various machine learning algorithms to develop our model, including random forest, K Nearest Neighbours and a Sequential Neural Network. These algorithms will prove effective in the classification of Twitter accounts, and we will evaluate the performance of the models via the accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of the algorithms. Moreover, with hyperparameter tuning, we will select the best parameters from the user data to efficiently classify bot accounts. Additionally, we will analyze the content of the tweets themselves, looking for patterns in the language used, the types of links shared, and the sentiment expressed. We will also conduct a cross-validation analysis to ensure that the model is robust and not overfitting the data.
